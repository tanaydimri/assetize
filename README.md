# This is A W.I.P. Tool.

A utility to help artists manage their scene better. 
While working on a scnee I had always faced a confusion as to how I can efficiently assemble all my assets together into one scene. As a result of this I always ended up using different techniques on every project, creating even further confusion.

I built Assetize with an intention to allow artists to refere an asset file once and then manage all reference switches and basic parameter tweaks from here.

Currently, the functionality is very minmal and it only creates "placers" in the scene to maintain a clean hierarchy. But later, I hope to extend this by giving some overrides for the file and abilities to switch between model file and the proxy fromt he same UI.
